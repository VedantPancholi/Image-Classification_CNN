This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. The notebook provides an end-to-end implementation for solving the image classification problem.

### Project Highlights

1. **Dataset**: 
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **Objective**: 
   - To classify images into their respective categories using a deep learning model.
   - Categories include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**:
     - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset and normalize image pixel values.
     - Apply one-hot encoding to the labels for multiclass classification.
   - **Model Architecture**:
     - Design a CNN using layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
     - Use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization for better generalization.
   - **Compilation and Training**:
     - Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).
     - Train the model on the training dataset while validating on a hold-out set.
   - **Evaluation**:
     - Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to measure its accuracy and performance metrics.
   - **Visualization**:
     - Visualize the training and validation loss and accuracy using matplotlib.
     - Display sample predictions to assess the model's performance qualitatively.

4. **Key Tools and Libraries**:
   - Python: The programming language used for implementation.
   - TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network.
   - NumPy and Matplotlib: For data manipulation and visualization.

5. **Expected Results**:
   - A trained CNN capable of achieving significant accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test dataset.
   - Insights into the performance of the model through graphical visualizations of metrics.
